# React Auth Starter

> React Auth Service built with the MERN stack along with Redux for state management, React MaterialUI. (based on Brad Traversy example)

## Quick Start

Add your MONGO_URI to the default.json file. Make sure you set an env var for that and the jwtSecret on deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment

Simply push to Heroku and it will build and load the client index.html page
